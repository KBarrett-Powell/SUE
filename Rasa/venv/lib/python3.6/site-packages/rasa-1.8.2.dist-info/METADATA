Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. With Rasa, you can build contexual assistants on:
- Facebook Messenger
- Slack
- Microsoft Bot Framework
- Rocket.Chat
- Mattermost
- Telegram
- Twilio
- Your own custom conversational channels

or voice assistants as:
- Alexa Skills
- Google Home Actions

Rasa helps you build contextual assistants capable of having layered conversations with 
lots of back-and-forth. In order for a human to have a meaningful exchange with a contextual 
assistant, the assistant needs to be able to use context to build on things that were previously 
discussed – Rasa enables you to build assistants that can do this in a scalable way.

There's a lot more background information in this

## Where to get help

There is extensive documentation in the [Rasa Docs](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa).
Make sure to select the correct version so you are looking at
the docs for the version you installed.

Please use [Rasa Community Forum](https://forum.rasa.com) for quick answers to
questions.

### How to contribute
We are very happy to receive and merge your contributions. You can
find more information about how to contribute to Rasa (in lots of
different ways!) [here](http://rasa.com/community/contribute).

To contribute via pull request, follow these steps:

1. Create an issue describing the feature you want to work on (or
   have a look at the [contributor board](https://github.com/orgs/RasaHQ/projects/23))
2. Write your code, tests and documentation, and format them with ``black``
3. Create a pull request describing your changes

Your pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer, who will get
back to you about any necessary changes or questions. You will
also be asked to sign a
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/RasaHQ/rasa).


## Development Internals

### Building from source

Rasa uses Poetry for packaging and dependency management. If you want to build it from source,
you have to install Poetry first. This is how it can be done:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3
```

There are several other ways to install Poetry. Please, follow 
[the official guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to see all possible options.

To install dependencies and `rasa` itself in editable mode execute
```
make install
```

### Running and changing the documentation

First of all, install all the required dependencies:
```
make install
```

After the installation has finished, you can run and view the documentation
locally using:
```
make livedocs
```

Visit the local version of the docs at http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
You can now change the docs locally and the web page will automatically reload
and apply your changes.

### Running the Tests
In order to run the tests, make sure that you have the development requirements installed:
```bash
export PIP_USE_PEP517=false
make prepare-tests-ubuntu # Only on Ubuntu and Debian based systems
make prepare-tests-macos  # Only on macOS
```

Then, run the tests:
```bash
make test
```

They can also be run at multiple jobs to save some time:
```bash
JOBS=[n] make test
```

Where `[n]` is the number of jobs desired. If omitted, `[n]` will be automatically chosen by pytest.

### Steps to release a new version
Releasing a new version is quite simple, as the packages are build and distributed by GitHub Actions.

*Terminology*:
* patch release (third version part increases): 1.1.2 -> 1.1.3
* minor release (second version part increases): 1.1.3 -> 1.2.0
* major release (first version part increases): 1.2.0 -> 2.0.0

*Release steps*:
1. Make sure all dependencies are up to date (**especially Rasa SDK**)
2. Switch to the branch you want to cut the release from (`master` in case of a major / minor, the current feature branch for patch releases) 
3. Run `make release`
4. Create a PR against master or the release branch (e.g. `1.2.x`)
5. Once your PR is merged, tag a new release (this SHOULD always happen on master or release branches), e.g. using
    ```bash
    git tag 1.2.0 -m "next release"
    git push origin 1.2.0
    ```
    GitHub will build this tag and push a package to [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rasa)
6. **If this is a minor release**, a new release branch should be created pointing to the same commit as the tag to allow for future patch releases, e.g.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b 1.2.x
    git push origin 1.2.x
    ```

### Code Style

To ensure a standardized code style we use the formatter [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).
To ensure our type annotations are correct we use the type checker [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype). 
If your code is not formatted properly or doesn't type check, GitHub will fail to build.

#### Formatting

If you want to automatically format your code on every commit, you can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
Just install it via `pip install pre-commit` and execute `pre-commit install` in the root folder.
This will add a hook to the repository, which reformats files on every commit.

If you want to set it up manually, install black via `poetry install`.
To reformat files execute
```
make formatter
```

#### Type Checking

If you want to check types on the codebase, install `pytype` using `poetry install`.
To check the types execute
```
make types
```

### Deploying documentation updates

We use `sphinx-versioning` to build docs for tagged versions and for the master branch.
The static site that gets built is pushed to the `docs` branch of this repo, which doesn't contain
any code, only the site.

We host the site on netlify. On master branch builds (see `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`), we push the built docs to the `docs`
branch. Netlify automatically re-deploys the docs pages whenever there is a change to that branch.
